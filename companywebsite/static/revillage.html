        Resident Evil Village[a] is a 2021 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017). Players control Ethan Winters, who is searching for his kidnapped daughter after a fateful encounter with Chris Redfield, and finds himself in a village filled with mutant creatures. While Village maintains the Resident Evil series' survival horror elements, the game adopts a more action-oriented gameplay style compared to its predecessor.

        The game was announced at the PlayStation 5 reveal event in June 2020 and was released on May 7, 2021, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Resident Evil Village received generally favorable reviews, being praised for its gameplay, setting, and variety, although it received criticism for its puzzles, boss fights and performance issues on the Microsoft Windows version. The game's increased focus on action over its predecessor received more mixed opinions.
